# Makers in Hubble vAMM (Part 2)

This is the second post in the “Makers in Hubble vAMM” series. In the first one, we discussed the payoffs of being a maker qualitatively. For this post, we performed some simulations to understand what to expect as a maker (liquidity provider) in the Hubble AMM.

For the simulation, we assume an efficient arb b/w FTX and Hubble. We performed the following steps.

- Start with x (= $5m, $10m) liquidity goal in the Hubble vAMM
- Get FTX avax-perp minutely data for the month of January
- For each data point (every minute), execute 4 efficient arbitrage (i.e. mark price on Hubble closely follows that on FTX) trades on Hubble — open, low, high, close. For e.g. on Jan 1 00:00, the [price_open, price_high, price_low, price_close] are [109.479, 109.897, 109.479, 109.809] respectively. So we execute 4 trades, that bring price parity with ftx on Hubble.
- At the end of the day, track the Maker’s daily apr, net apr until that time, PnL, volume, depth and slippage

Note that the apr here **includes the impermanent loss** — this is super important to take note of because most protocols never talk about it and only mention the “fee apr” which is always > 0. So,
