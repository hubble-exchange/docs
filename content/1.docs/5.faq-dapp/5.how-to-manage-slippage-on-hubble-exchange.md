# How to manage Slippage?

## How to manage Slippage for Trading and Adding Liquidity on Hubble Exchange?

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. When market orders are used, these orders buy or sell at the price offered by the market thus lowering/rising the price as a result. To reduce slippage for traders Hubble uses a model (Curve invariant) that concentrates liquidity around the market price.

All traders should be aware of slippage and carefully pay attention to the impact their trade will have on the market. You can select the maximum allowed slippage for your trades.

1. Click on the **Preference Icon** on the top right corder of the buy/sell box while trading and on add liquidity modal while providing liquidity
