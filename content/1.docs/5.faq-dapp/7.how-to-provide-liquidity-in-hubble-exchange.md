# How to Provide a Liquidity in Hubble Exchange?

Hubble is a vAMM, it uses a model like UniSwap or Curve but instead of using real tokens it uses virtualized tokens (derivatives that follow the price of the underlying asset). For every position opened by a trader in Hubble, there is a counter position opened for all makers and they share it in the ratio of their liquidity. Since the makers are being traded against, most often (but not always) makers will end up taking the unpopular position and hence be paid funding payments. Passive incoooome.

**Your gain is the** `trading fee + funding payments + liquidity mining rewards (if any).`

A difference between providing liquidity in Hubble as opposed to AMMs is that unlike traditional LP tokens, within Hubble, contracts are not backed by the underlying assets but by the deposited collateral (Margin Balance). You can provide liquidity on leverage i.e. you can add more virtual liquidity than your margin and earn fees on leveraged liquidity. A consequence of this is liquidations are possible.
