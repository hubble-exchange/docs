# How to Open an Isolated Margin Position on Hubble Exchange?

Hubble is a cross-margin multi-collateral perpetual futures protocol. This means **all deposited tokens as well as all open positions are used as collateral for every single position**. This is particularly beneficial for those seeking capital efficiency to use gains/profits in one position to fund another. But what if you want to open a position without putting all of your collateral + all your open positions at stake? What if you want to control exactly what and how much you are willing to bet?

Hubble does not technically support isolated-margin but there is a very easy workaround: create an additional MetaMask account, send the collateral you want to isolate for your position to this second account, deposit it in Hubble and start your position.

Hereâ€™s how you can create a new account on MetaMask:
