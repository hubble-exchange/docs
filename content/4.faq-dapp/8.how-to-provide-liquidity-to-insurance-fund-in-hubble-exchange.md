# How to provide liquidity to the Insurance Fund in Hubble Exchange?

Hubbleâ€™s Policy Team carefully evaluates assets listed as collateral for sufficient consistent volumes, healthy market depth, relatively low slippage in case they need to be liquidated as collateral. Each asset also has risk perimeters such as a Reserve Factor, Liquidation Threshold, specifically chosen for them. **These risk perimeters are chosen to reduce the probability of scenarios where the liquidated collateral does not cover the debt of a trader.** If such a scenario presents itself, the insurance fund would swoop in to prevent insolvency.

**The insurance fund** guarantees the profitable side when counter-party collateral is insufficient, usually when the price of the asset has moved sharply in one direction and the exchange was unable to liquidate at a profit. Essentially, users can deposit hUSD into the insurance fund and take the risk of losing a portion of it in the occurrence that margin is insufficient to cover the loss. In exchange for taking this risk, **insurance fund liquidity providers receive a portion of the trading fees and a 50% share in the liquidation fees** alongside the liquidator.
