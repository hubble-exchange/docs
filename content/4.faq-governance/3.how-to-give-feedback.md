# How to Provide Feedback and Earn HubbleBucks?

## Introducing Hubble Bucks

This is a currency within the Hubble Discord, primarily used to reward Tickets created on

[https://feedback.hubble.exchange/](https://feedback.hubble.exchange/). We are decommissioning the xp-system we previously had on the server with the new and improved HubbleBucks - a new way to reward Hubblers!

Starting today, you can earn HubbleBucks for providing feedback on

[https://feedback.hubble.exchange/](https://feedback.hubble.exchange/)

**Only tickets that follow guidelines will be eligible to earn HubbleBucks.**

## What do you need to know before creating a ticket?

First, here are two reasons for creating a ticket: 

::list{type="info"}
- Bug Fixes: [https://feedback.hubble.exchange/bug-fixes](https://feedback.hubble.exchange/bug-fixes)
- Feature Requests: [https://feedback.hubble.exchange/features](https://feedback.hubble.exchange/features)
::

Bug Fixes and Feature Requests have separate boards. When creating a ticket, make sure to use the appropriate board, depending on if you're submitting a bug or feature.

**If you would like to provide casual feedback and you are not reporting a bug fix or requesting a feature , please do not create a ticket.** Send a message in the feedback channel instead, it'll cheer up the Hubblenauts


## How do you create a ticket?

Each ticket composes of two section, '*title*' and '*details*'. Here's how each section should be used.

**Title:**
 In this section, very briefly describe the bug you have found or the feature request. Be brief, but specific. Example: "*4hr-timeframe-in-the-tradingview-chart*" or "*error-received-when-closing-short-baseassetquantity-0*"

**Details:**
  - **Bugs:** Describe the bug in as much detail as possible. Was there an error message? Include a picture and showcase the bug. It’s important to communicate the steps you took that led to it, so the bug can be replicated and identified. 

  - **Features:** For feature requests, you can describe the feature you’d like to see on Hubble. If the feature is available on another perpetual futures exchange, feel free to share a picture as an example.

**Include your discord username. If your ticket meets the guidelines and is marked as “planned”, you will receive HubbleBucks in the next 7 days. You may also need to be contacted for more details about the bug you report, so we may send you a message.**

**Example:** "This notification was received when approving ETH while adding it as collateral. There is a small typo in the word “transaction”. Image is attached. Discord Username: kepler#5783"

Here are some more things to keep in mind

::list{type="info"}
- Each ticket should contain only one bug or one feature.
- Before opening a ticket, confirm that the bug or feature has not already been requested or reported. HubbleBucks will not be provided for bugs or features that have already been reported.
- Tickets that have the highest upvotes will be prioritized. To receive upvotes from the community, make your ticket easy to read, clear and concise.
- All tickets should be in English.
